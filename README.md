Visualization of data structures and algorithms using Python and Tkinter

This repository visualizes many basic data structures and algorithms to help new computer scientists understand them.
Most of the visualizations were designed to accompany the textbook,
_Data Structures and Algorithms in Python_ by John Canning, Alan Broder, and
Robert Lafore.  See the https://datastructures.live website for more information
about the textbook.
Interactive exploration of the algorithms along with analysis in the text deepens student understanding.

The implementation is in Python using its interface to Tk (tkinter) to animate the operations.

Exceptional students in the Computer Science Department of Stern College for Women at Yeshiva University helped develop these visualizations.
